#Bomb Diffusing Game
Welcome to the Bomb Diffusing Game, a Java-based entertainment where your guessing skills are put to the test! Can you defuse the bomb by guessing the correct number between 1 and 5 within just 5 attempts? Let's find out!

#Introduction
In this Java game, players are challenged to defuse a virtual bomb by correctly guessing a random number. With only 5 attempts at their disposal, players must use their intuition and deduction skills to win the game. Your victory depends on your ability to choose the right number before the bomb "explodes"!

#How to Play
