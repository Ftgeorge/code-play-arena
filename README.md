# Code Play Arena
Welcome to the Code Play Arena repository! Here, we showcase the practical implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and classes through a collection of engaging Java console games.

# Introduction
In this repository, we delve into the world of OOP using Java to create captivating console games. Each game demonstrates various OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, providing an educational and entertaining resource for both novice and experienced programmers.

# Games Included
Currently, the repository features the following console games:

Bomb-Diffusing: Can you defuse the bomb by guessing the correct number between 1 and 5 within just 5 attempts? Let's find out!
